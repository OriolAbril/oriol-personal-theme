# Contributing guidelines

## Before contributing

Welcome to oriol-personal-theme!

This is the theme I use on my personal website.
Contributions are welcome as long as I like seeing
them on my website.

I have published the theme as an open source repo,
but unless other people like it and are willing to help
develop and maintain it this will only ever be a personal
project, no backwards compatibility, no new features or options
I won't use.

Therefore, beware, you should **reach out on issues before investing significant time on this**.
